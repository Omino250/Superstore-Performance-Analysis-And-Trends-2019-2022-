# 📊 Superstore Sales & Performance Report(2019–2022)

## 🎯 Project Overview

The Superstore operates across multiple regions in the United States, selling **Technology, Furniture, and Office Supplies** to different customer segments. While the business generated millions in revenue, decision-makers lacked a clear, centralized view of performance.
Key questions remained unanswered:

•	Which product categories actually drive revenue and profit?

•	Which customer segments contribute the most value?

•	How sales trend across time, regions, and shipping modes?

•	Where operational inefficiencies reduce profitability?

To address this, I built an **end-to-end Excel analytics solution**, transforming raw transactional data into a structured **EDA workbook** and a fully **interactive dashboard**.
This project covers the complete analytics workflow, from data cleaning to exploratory analysis and dashboard design, delivering actionable business insights in a single view.

## ⚠️ Business Challenge

The Superstore dataset contained **10,194 transaction records** with mixed formats, unstructured fields, and no ready-to-use analytical structure.
Challenges included:
•	No clear KPIs to track overall performance

•	Difficulties comparing sales across categories, regions, and years

•	Limited visibility into customer behavior and shipping efficiency

•	No centralized view for leadership decision-making

Without analysis, performance optimization was largely guesswork.
